# Ideas for Talk Proposals
> Inspired by the [PyData Amsterdam CfP](https://pydata.org/amsterdam2020/cfp/) folks and aiming to help everyone who wants to learn how to put talk proposals together, I created this repo. If you have suggestions or would like to add something, please just submit a PR.  
Repo with ideas for talk proposals and aids on how to put together a talk.

## How to
### Write a good proposal
The fist place where you should look for guidance is the CfP of the conference/meetup that you would like to submit to. Usually, that is a great starting point. Then, you can have a look at the articles below and try and draft your proposal. Ask someone to have a look at it before you submit it. And remember: good talks can be cut-off too, just keep trying.
* [So, You Wanna Submit a Proposal to Speak at an Event](https://css-tricks.com/so-you-wanna-submit-a-proposal-to-speak-at-an-event/): one of my favourite guides on how to write and submit a good proposal.
* [Conference Talk proposal Examples by ThoughtBot](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/conference-talk-proposal-examples)
* [PyData Amsterdam CfP guide](https://pydata.org/amsterdam2020/cfp/): Awesome overall guidelines.

## Themes and ideas
* Environment setup (how did you learn X? Why is it useful? How? What worked bets for you and how did it chamge your workflow?)
* Best practice on your field (what does it look like? tips for begginers?)
* Libraries and Packages - what is your most recent adoption? any favourites? demo with use-case.
* What have you built lately? Any cracking idea that could be a good begginers tool? Story telling is a big one for speakers.

## You proposal
If you have a proposal already and is not really sure about it, or would like some revision but don't know how?  
Leave a link (GDocs or GitHub) under this section and we will try and find some awesome mentors to revise them and work on some feedback for you.
